🚀 Robo Advisor - Boost Your Future Wealth
A smart, risk-aware financial planning application powered by Python algorithms and visualized with a stunning, modern Streamlit interface.


🌟 Overview
This Robo Advisor helps users plan their financial future with precision. It combines a conversational Goal Planner, a detailed Budget Analyzer, and a comprehensive Wealth Dashboard into a single, intuitive application. The app uses a "Rocket/Space" themed dark mode design for an engaging user experience.

Key Features
💬 Goal Planner (Chat):

Natural language interface to describe financial goals (e.g., "Plan 50 lakh for a house in 10 years").

Automatically extracts target amounts, time horizons, and expected returns.

Calculates inflation-adjusted targets and required monthly SIPs.

Risk Profiling: Integrated 6-factor questionnaire (Age, Income Stability, Crash Reaction, etc.) to determine if you are Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive.

💰 Budget Planner:

Income-based budgeting tool to analyze cash flow.

Calculates "Free Cash" and "Savings Rate" instantly.

Visualizes expenses vs. investments using dynamic charts.

Provides actionable insights on emergency fund coverage and savings habits.

📊 Analytics Dashboard:

Centralized view of all saved goals.

What-If Simulations: Adjust sliders to see how changes in returns or years affect your corpus.

Asset Allocation: View detailed investment splits (Equity vs. Debt vs. Hybrid) tailored to your specific risk profile.

Goal Cards: Beautifully rendered cards summarizing each goal's progress and requirements.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend & UI: Streamlit (Python-based web framework)

Styling: Custom CSS (Glassmorphism, Gradient Text, Animations)

Data Processing: pandas

Visualizations: plotly

Logic: Custom Python modules for financial math and risk assessment.


🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher installed.

Installation

🎨 Design Philosophy
The application moves away from standard data dashboards by implementing a custom "Space/Rocket" theme:

Deep Navy Backgrounds (#050A18) with Aurora-like gradients.

Glassmorphism on cards and inputs for a modern, layered feel.

Linear Gradients on buttons and text (#6C28FE to #FF007A).

SVG Illustrations embedded directly for visual storytelling without external assets.
